# Can Split Equally - Java Coding Challenge.

Interviewer wanted to know if this code could be optimized.  I said it looked pretty optimal as-is.

Bottom line is:  The original Method 1 is optimal enough because it performs the required operations in
a generalized manner and it can be counted upon to produce good known results.

Sorry Mr. Interviewer but your idea is not gonna work.
